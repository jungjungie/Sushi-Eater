## Description

This app allows users to input the names of sushi they would like to eat. Newly entered sushi will be displayed on the left side of the page with a 'Yum! Enjoy!' button. When the user clicks this button, the sushi will move to the right side of the page and then the user has the option to remove the menu item altogether.  

This app is built with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM and is deployed through Heroku.
